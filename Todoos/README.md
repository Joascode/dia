# Siri Todoos application

This application was an experiment in which I use different packages together with built-in API's for iOS. In this case I used an external package for managing the rendering of lists and Siri for speech recognition. Through Siri you can create new ToDo's, which Siri adds to the list of ToDo's for you.
